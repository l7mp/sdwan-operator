# A Survey of Distributed AI Training and Inferencing on Kubernetes

The rise of large-scale AI models has made distributed inferencing and training a necessity, and Kubernetes has emerged as a leading platform for orchestrating these complex workloads. A critical aspect of this orchestration is how "worker" pods -- the computational units performing the inferencing/training -- discover and communicate with each other. This report provides a breadth-first survey of the various Kubernetes abstractions and models that enable this crucial worker-to-worker communication.

### Core Kubernetes Networking: The Foundational Layer

At its core, Kubernetes provides a flat networking model where every pod has a unique, routable IP address within the cluster. This fundamental principle enables direct pod-to-pod communication, forming the basis for all distributed training setups. However, relying on ephemeral pod IPs is impractical. Instead, several Kubernetes abstractions are used to manage and facilitate this communication.

**Kubernetes Services: The Stable Endpoint**

The most common abstraction for enabling communication is the Kubernetes **Service**. A standard `ClusterIP` Service provides a stable virtual IP address and a DNS name that resolves to that IP. This Service then load-balances traffic across a set of pods identified by a label selector. While simple and effective for many microservices, the added layer of abstraction and load balancing might not be ideal for all distributed inferencing/training scenarios where workers may need to address each other directly.

**Headless Services: Direct Pod Discovery**

For many distributed AI frameworks, a **Headless Service** is the preferred method for worker discovery. Unlike a `ClusterIP` Service, a Headless Service does not have its own IP address. Instead, it creates DNS A records that point directly to the IP addresses of the individual pods backing the service. This allows each worker pod to obtain the IP addresses of all its peers by performing a DNS lookup on the Headless Service's name, enabling direct and efficient pod-to-pod communication. This is particularly crucial for stateful applications and distributed databases that often form the backbone of data-intensive AI workloads.

**The Role of DNS in Kubernetes**

Underpinning service discovery is the Kubernetes DNS service, typically implemented by **CoreDNS**. It automatically assigns DNS names to Services and, in the case of Headless Services, to the individual pods they manage. This allows applications to communicate using stable DNS names rather than volatile IP addresses, a critical feature for the dynamic nature of pod lifecycles in Kubernetes.

## Distributed AI Training on Kubernetes

Distributed training is a computationally intensive, offline process with one goal: to reduce the total time-to-train on massive datasets and enable models too large for a single accelerator. This requires maximizing computational throughput and minimizing idle time across a large fleet of workers. The core challenge in distributed training is efficiently parallelizing the learning process and, crucially, synchronizing the model's state across all workers. This inter-worker communication, typically for aggregating gradients, is the primary bottleneck and directly impacts how quickly a model can converge.

*   **Data Parallelism:** This is the most common technique, where each worker holds a full replica of the model but processes a different slice of the data. After each training step, all workers must perform a collective communication operation (like an `All-Reduce`) to average their calculated gradients, a process that is highly sensitive to network bandwidth and topology.
*   **Pipeline Parallelism:** Here, the model's layers are broken into sequential stages, with each stage on a different worker. To keep all workers utilized, data is fed through in micro-batches, but this creates a "pipeline bubble" of idle time that must be minimized. Communication of activations (forward pass) and gradients (backward pass) occurs between adjacent stages.
*   **Tensor Parallelism:** This technique is used for individual model layers that are too large for a single accelerator's memory. It partitions a layer's operations across multiple workers, requiring high-frequency, low-latency communication to exchange results during both the forward and backward passes.


Below is a summary of the most prominent distributed training frameworks for Kubernetes:

*   **Horovod:** This popular open-source distributed training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch often relies on **Message Passing Interface (MPI)** and **SSH** for inter-worker communication. When running on Kubernetes, a Headless Service is typically used to provide the stable hostnames necessary for the MPI environment to be established.
*   **Ray:** An open-source framework for scaling AI and Python applications, Ray utilizes the **KubeRay operator** to manage Ray clusters on Kubernetes. A Ray cluster consists of a head node that manages the cluster and worker nodes that execute tasks. Communication between the head and worker nodes, as well as between workers, is often handled via **gRPC**. The KubeRay operator automates the setup of the necessary services for this communication.
*   **MPI-based Workloads:** For traditional high-performance computing (HPC) workloads using MPI, the **`mpi-operator`** is a common choice. This operator simplifies the deployment of MPI jobs and typically uses a Headless Service to provide stable DNS entries for each worker pod, enabling them to discover each other.
*   **Kubeflow:** This comprehensive MLOps platform includes a **Training Operator** that supports various distributed training backends. For TensorFlow, it can facilitate a parameter server architecture, while for PyTorch, it supports distributed data parallelism. The Training Operator automatically creates the necessary Kubernetes Services and sets up environment variables within the worker pods to enable communication according to the chosen strategy.

This table outlines the common frameworks and Kubernetes-native abstractions used for distributed training, focusing on how they facilitate communication between worker pods.

| Framework / Tool | Primary Worker-Worker Communication Abstraction | Discovery Mechanism | Typical Pod Controller | Key Characteristics & Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Horovod** | Direct Pod-to-Pod (via MPI or Gloo) | **Headless Service** | `Job` / `IndexedJob` / Custom Operator (`mpi-operator`) | A `HorovodRun` or similar CRD creates a launcher pod that uses `kubectl exec` or SSH to start MPI processes in worker pods discovered via the Headless Service. |
| **MPI-based Workloads** | Direct Pod-to-Pod (via MPI) | **Headless Service** | `MPIJob` (via `mpi-operator`) | The `mpi-operator` standardizes MPI job launches. It creates a Headless Service to provide stable hostnames for the `mpirun` command's host file. |
| **Ray** | Direct Pod-to-Pod (via gRPC) | **Headless Service** for Ray workers, `ClusterIP` for the head. | `RayCluster` (via `KubeRay operator`) | The KubeRay operator creates a Headless Service for workers to join the cluster managed by the head node. All task-related communication is direct pod-to-pod. |
| **Kubeflow Training Operator** | Direct Pod-to-Pod | **Headless Service** / Environment Variables | `PyTorchJob`, `TFJob`, etc. | The operator automatically creates a Headless Service and injects environment variables (like `MASTER_ADDR`, `WORLD_SIZE`) into each pod for discovery. |
| **Indexed Jobs** | Direct Pod-to-Pod | Predictable DNS Hostnames | `Job` (with `completionMode: Indexed`) | Kubernetes natively provides stable hostnames (e.g., `job-name-i.subdomain`) for each pod, which can be used for discovery without a Headless Service. |
| **JobSet API** | Direct Pod-to-Pod | **Automatically Created Headless Service** | `JobSet` | A higher-level API that automates the creation of a Headless Service for the managed jobs, simplifying worker discovery for the entire group. |
| **High-Performance Networking** | Direct Memory Access (RDMA) | **Headless Service** | Any (e.g., `JobSet`, `MPIJob`) | Not a framework, but an enhancement. Uses a Network Operator to manage InfiniBand/RoCE hardware. The Headless Service is still used for initial IP discovery. |

## Distributed AI Inferencing on Kubernetes

While distributed training is a computationally intensive, offline process, distributed inference presents a different set of challenges. It must serve real-time requests with low latency and high throughput, often requiring a "divide and conquer" strategy for very large models. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of how distributed AI inference frameworks map their inter-worker communication needs onto Kubernetes networking abstractions.

The core challenge in distributed inference is splitting a large model across multiple "workers" (pods) and orchestrating their collaboration to process a single incoming request. This inter-worker communication is critical for performance. The choice of Kubernetes networking abstraction directly impacts the latency and scalability of the inference service.

*   **Tensor Parallelism:** This technique partitions a model's individual layers across multiple workers. During an inference request, all workers must communicate to exchange intermediate activations, a process that is highly sensitive to network latency.
*   **Pipeline Parallelism:** Here, the model's layers are broken into sequential stages, with each stage running on a different worker. A request passes through the pipeline from the first stage to the last. Communication occurs between adjacent stages in the pipeline.
*   **Hybrid Approaches:** Many advanced systems combine both tensor and pipeline parallelism to optimize throughput and latency for massive models.

A new generation of inference servers has emerged to handle the complexities of serving large models. These systems often manage the underlying Kubernetes networking for the user.

*   **vLLM:** A high-throughput serving engine for LLMs, vLLM can be deployed in a distributed fashion using tensor parallelism. When deployed on Kubernetes, a vLLM setup typically uses a `StatefulSet` to provide stable pod identities and a corresponding **Headless Service** for service discovery. This allows the different vLLM worker pods to find each other and establish direct communication channels for exchanging tensor data during inference. The use of a StatefulSet ensures that if a pod restarts, it retains its stable network identity (e.g., `vllm-worker-0`, `vllm-worker-1`), which is crucial for predictable communication patterns.

*   **TensorRT-LLM:** NVIDIA's solution for optimizing and serving LLMs also relies on tensor parallelism for distributed inference. Similar to vLLM, deployments on Kubernetes leverage direct pod-to-pod communication, often facilitated by a **Headless Service** for the workers to discover each other's IP addresses.

*   **Seldon Core:** A comprehensive open-source platform for deploying machine learning models on Kubernetes, Seldon Core provides a high-level `SeldonDeployment` custom resource. For complex inference graphs, which can represent pipeline parallelism, Seldon automatically configures the necessary Kubernetes networking. It creates a **Headless Service** for each component in the graph, enabling direct communication between the stages of the pipeline. This abstracts the networking complexity away from the user, who only needs to define the inference graph.

This table outlines the common frameworks and Kubernetes-native abstractions used for distributed inferencing, focusing on how they facilitate communication between worker pods.

A `StatefulSet` provides stable worker identities (`worker-0`, `worker-1`) which are made discoverable via a Headless Service for direct data exchange.                                          |
| **Seldon Core**                 | Direct Pod-to-Pod (via gRPC/REST)                    | **Headless Service per Component**         | `SeldonDeployment`                           | For inference graphs (pipeline parallelism), Seldon creates a microservice for each step. A Headless Service for each enables direct calls between pipeline stages.                                                           |

For distributed models, the predictor itself is often a set of pods (e.g., using vLLM) that communicate internally via a Headless Service.                                  |

It automates the creation of `StatefulSets` and the necessary Headless Service for discovery.                                                                |
| **High-Performance Networking** | Direct Memory Access (RDMA)                          | **Headless Service**                       | Any (e.g., `StatefulSet`, `LeaderWorkerSet`) | Crucial for ultra-low-latency tensor parallelism. Allows GPU-Direct RDMA between workers. Still relies on a Headless Service for the initial IP address lookup.                                                               |
| **General Pattern**             | **Ingress → `ClusterIP` Service → Headless Service** | DNS                                        | `Deployment` / `StatefulSet`                 | A common pattern where external traffic hits a stable `ClusterIP` Service fronting a "router" or "leader" pod, which then communicates with a pool of workers via their direct IPs discovered through a **Headless Service**. |
